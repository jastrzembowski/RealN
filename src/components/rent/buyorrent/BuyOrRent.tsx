        <h1> Are you deciding between renting or buying a house? </h1><p>Maybe
        you’re ready to move out of your rental and into your own home. Or
        perhaps you’re relocating to a new city and contemplating whether to
        rent a home before making the leap to homeownership. Whatever your
        reasons, take a moment to consider how renting vs. buying a home will
        affect your life now and in the future. Should I rent or buy a house? 3
        questions to ask yourself Each of us has a unique lifestyle, financial
        situation, and set of long-term life goals that impacts our decision
        whether to rent or buy a house. To sort this all out for yourself,
        consider three main questions. 1) Does renting or buying work with your
        timeline? One of the most important questions to consider when deciding
        between renting versus buying a home is your timeline. For example, if
        you’ve just moved to a city, expect a job change soon, or don’t plan to
        stay in the community long, it may make more sense to rent. Selling a
        home costs money, and if you sell too soon after buying, it may not be
        worth it. On the other hand, if you've found a community where you'd
        like to put down roots, buying may be the better option. Owning a home
        offers more stability and potentially more financial benefits for
        homebuyers who plan to live in an area for more than just a few years.
        2) How much can you afford? Buying and renting each have their own costs
        to consider - and this can make the difference between becoming a renter
        or a homeowner. To buy, you'll need enough money in the bank to afford a
        down payment and closing costs. How much that will be depends on your
        home loan, your lender, housing market, and more. Many buyers put down
        as little as 3%, though a larger down payment will usually save you
        money on interest and mortgage insurance. There are also ongoing costs
        of owning a home—mortgage payments, maintenance, utilities, and
        different types of homeowners insurance. Learn more about what it costs
        to buy a house or use a mortgage calculator to get an idea of what you
        can afford. If buying a home would take all your savings or stretch your
        monthly budget, it may make sense to keep renting for now. To rent, you
        typically just need to fill out a rental application, an application
        fee, a security deposit, and first and last month’s rent. Deciding to
        rent can also give you time to raise your credit score, potentially
        saving you money in mortgage interest and other loan-related costs. Keep
        in mind that your monthly rent payment is likely to increase each time
        your lease is up for renewal. Depending on the housing market, you may
        end up paying more for rent than for a mortgage payment. A rent vs. buy
        calculator can help you evaluate which is best for your situation, but
        remember that it's only a rough estimate. 3) Will renting or buying a
        home fit your lifestyle? Renting vs. buying a house is also a lifestyle
        question. Homeownership is a long-term investment that can enable you to
        build wealth over time. That means treating your home as an investment
        and caring for it accordingly, with regular maintenance and repairs.
        Buying also comes with pride of ownership and the freedom to make
        decisions about style and upgrades that you typically don't have as a
        renter. In fact, in some markets buying a home with a yard, garage, or
        that third bedroom you've been wanting may be more affordable than
        trying to rent the equivalent property. On the other hand, you may have
        good lifestyle reasons to continue renting rather than buying a home.
        Renting could be preferable if you'd rather not deal with the
        responsibility of home maintenance and the likelihood of paying for
        emergency repairs. Maybe a change is on the horizon, like a career
        transition or a child attending a different school, where renting a home
        makes more financial sense and aligns better with your long-term goals.
        Renting may also be a good choice if you have a busy lifestyle, move
        around a lot, or simply prefer more freedom and aren't ready for a big
        commitment. Renting vs. buying: pros and cons As you decide whether you
        should rent or buy a house, consider the pros and cons of each. Pros of
        renting a house Home repairs: If something breaks in a home you're
        renting, it's typically on the landlord to fix, not you. So when the air
        conditioning unit stops working in the middle of summer, you don’t have
        to spend thousands of dollars to fix it. Monthly housing expenses: For
        the most part, when renting a house your monthly housing costs will stay
        the same, aside from minor fluctuations in utility costs. Your base rent
        doesn’t change and you likely won’t need to budget for any emergency
        repairs, maintenance costs, or factor in property taxes. Flexibility:
        You can move out when your lease is finished or relocate to another city
        without having to worry about selling your home. Renting a house also
        allows you to see which home styles you like, which floor plans you
        don’t like, and if a neighborhood is the right fit, before buying a
        home. Investment opportunities: Renting can free up some of your income,
        since you won’t be spending it on repairs or upgrades. You may have
        extra funds, also called disposable income, to invest in building your
        finances rather than investing in a home. You may even be able to save
        money towards a down payment. Cons of renting a house Temporary: The
        biggest pro of renting is also the biggest con. If you’re planning to
        put down roots in a community, renting may not be the best option, as
        most leases last for only a year or two. Uncertainty: There's no telling
        when the home's owner may decide they don't want the responsibility of
        being a landlord anymore. When your rent is up, they can decide to sell,
        which means you'll need to relocate. Similarly, when your lease is up,
        your apartment may not offer you the option to renew your lease.
        Possible rent increases: When renting, each year you renew your lease
        it’s possible your rent will increase. Depending on whether you
        negotiate rent, the new cost may be out of your budget. In that case,
        you’ll likely need to find a new rental. No home equity: As a renter,
        you don’t build any equity—that's the percentage of the home's value
        you've paid for, rather than what your lender still owns. When you pay
        your rent each month, you're helping someone else build equity, when you
        could use those funds to improve your own finances. As-is home: You
        usually don't have the option of modifying a rental home to suit your
        needs. Some landlords may allow you to make small changes like painting
        the walls in your living space, but you'll probably have to paint them
        back to the original color when you move out. Pros of buying a house
        Building equity: As a homeowner, you’ll have a chance to build equity
        and potentially increase your home’s value. The longer you own your
        home, the more equity you have, and the more money you're likely to make
        when you sell it. Equity can also allow you to borrow money for big
        expenses and build wealth that benefits you later in life. Customizable:
        Buying a home means it’s yours - you can paint it, remodel it, and
        customize the space to your liking without having to follow a landlord’s
        rules. This pride of ownership is a big advantage for those looking to
        settle down. Stability: You won’t be at the mercy of a landlord who may
        decide to sell the home once your lease is up. You have the freedom to
        decide how long you want to stay in the home, and ultimately if or when
        you want to sell. Tax benefits: Some homeowners qualify for tax breaks,
        which are reductions in your federal or state taxes. Many first-time
        buyers can receive tax deductions, such as on their mortgage interest,
        which can save you money at tax time.</p>
